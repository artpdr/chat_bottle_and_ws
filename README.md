# A chat made with python, bottle and websockets
This is a very simple chat without any security measures (code injection among others can be performed). You just pick a username in the entrance page and next you can communicate in a public chat with all the users that are logged in.

This chat was made after using bottle and websockets in a university's project. I decided to make it because there aren't many chat examples with this technologies together.

## Installation
1. In terminal, go to the folder where "chat" folder is but don't enter inside "chat" folder;
2. Type sudo pip install -e chat.

## Using the chat (in the server side)
1. In terminal, go to chat/chatOn/
2. Type chatOn_server

## Using the chat (@ client side)
1. Open your browser and type in the address bar: localhost:8080
